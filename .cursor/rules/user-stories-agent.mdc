- US1 (Logging): As a user, I want to quickly add a new symptom with its name, perceived severity, and optional notes, so I can accurately record how I'm feeling at a specific time.
- US2 (Viewing Today): As a user, I want to see all symptoms I've logged for the current day in a clear, chronological list, so I can get an overview of my day.
- US3 (Viewing History): As a user, I want to easily navigate to and view symptoms logged on previous days, so I can identify patterns or recall past experiences.
- US4 (Editing): As a user, I want to be able to edit or delete a symptom entry I made, in case I made a mistake or my perception of the symptom changes.
- US5 (Reminder): As a user, I want to receive a reminder notification at the end of the day, so I don't forget to log any symptoms I might have missed or to do a final check-in.
- US6 (Symptom Reuse): As a user, when adding a new symptom, I want to see suggestions based on symptoms I've previously logged, so I can log recurring symptoms faster and maintain consistency.
- US7 (Simplicity): As a user, I want the app to be extremely simple and focused, without overwhelming features, so I can log my symptoms without friction.
