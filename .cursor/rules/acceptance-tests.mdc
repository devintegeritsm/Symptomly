Acceptance tests for Remedy Card feature

<example>
Given I open the Remedy Card  
When I select **Potency** = `30C`  
Then *wait‑and‑watch* defaults to **1 week**  
And *effectiveness due date* shows exactly 7 days ahead.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
❌ If potency is `200C` and wait‑and‑watch is manually set to **2 weeks**, saving must also push the *effectiveness due date* by 2 weeks; failing to sync is invalid.
</example>
