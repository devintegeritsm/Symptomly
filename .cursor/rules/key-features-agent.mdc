- 5.2. Daily Diary View:
- Main Screen: Defaults to showing symptoms logged for the current day.
- Chronological List: Symptoms displayed in reverse chronological order (most recent first).
- Entry Display: Each entry should clearly show symptom name, severity, time, and a snippet of notes (if any).
- "Add New Symptom" Button: Prominently displayed (e.g., floating action button or "+" in navigation bar).
- 5.3. Historical View:
- Calendar Navigation: A simple way to select a previous date (e.g., a mini-calendar picker, or "<" ">" buttons to go day-by-day).
- Display: Shows logged symptoms for the selected date, similar to the Daily Diary View.

- 5.7  Remedy Card (new)
- Present a Remedy Card component on the Logging screen with a visually distinct style (pill‑shaped container, teal accent background).
- Remedy Name  
  - Provide a text input with autocomplete.  
  - Autocomplete priority: remedies previously entered by the user (local history) ⇒ predefined remedies list.
- Remedy Potency  
  - Segmented control / menu with static options: `6C`, `30C`, `200C`, `1M`, `Other`.  
  - Selecting Other prompts free‑text potency entry.
- Timestamp when remedy taken  
  - Pre‑populate with `Date.now()` when the card opens. Allow the user to tap to edit; constrain edits to past/future within ±72 h.
- Remedy wait‑and‑watch period  
  - Auto‑compute default duration:  
    - `6C` → 1 day  
    - `30C` → 1 week  
    - `200C` → 1 month  
    - `1M` → 2 months  
  - Display as number + unit picker (hours / days / weeks / months). Updating it updates Remedy effectiveness due date.
- Remedy effectiveness due date  
  - Auto‑calculate as `takenTimestamp + waitAndWatch`. Changing this date back‑propagates to the wait‑and‑watch picker.
- Timestamp prescribed on  
  - Default to `Date.now()`. Editable by tap.
- Prescription repeat schedule toggle  
  - Off by default. When on, reveal Prescription schedule settings.
- Prescription schedule settings  
  - Recurrence rule picker supporting:  
    - Daily  
    - Multiple times per day (specify frequency & interval)  
    - Every other day  
    - Weekly / Biweekly (`biweekly`)  
    - Monthly  
  - End Repeat date picker; mandatory when repeat is enabled.  
  - On save, schedule local notification(s) matching the rule.
- Notes – optional multi‑line text field.
- Save Remedy button persists the record, dismisses the card, and publishes a SwiftData `didSaveRemedy` event.

- 5.8  Remedy Card behavior in the app (new)
- Display the Remedy Card in the Logging screen alongside the Symptom Card; ensure a contrasting background (`.backgroundStyle(.thickMaterial)`).
- On the Daily View calendar:  
  - Show remedy entries on their *taken* timestamps.  
  - If repeat schedule is enabled, show future occurrences as faded placeholders.  
- On each Symptom Card, list active remedies whose *wait‑and‑watch* window encompasses the symptom's timestamp OR whose repeat schedule overlaps the symptom date. Use a small "pill" label (`RemedyName • Potency`) under the symptom intensity bar.
